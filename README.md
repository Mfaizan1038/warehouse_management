We built this Warehouse Management System using Django to provide an organized way to manage warehouses, categories, and inventory items. The system allows users to view all warehouses, drill down into specific categories, and see detailed information about individual items. It also supports searching inventory by item type and updating stock levels by adding quantities, with validation to prevent errors like negative values. In addition, we implemented user roles (Employer and Employee) to manage job postings and applications, allowing employers to create jobs and employees to apply with a CV and cover letter. Overall, the project works as a centralized platform for both warehouse inventory management and basic job management, making operations smoother and more efficient.
